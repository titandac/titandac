# Titan DAC
## Goal
To fund future Metis community events and charitable giving consistent with the UN sustainable goals.

## Membership
The DAC is open to anyone to join.

## Funding
The DAC will initially be funded by proceeds from the sales of the initial Titan DAC NFT's as well as an additional contribution from the Metislab Foundation. We plan on minting more NFT'S in the future with a smart contract to capture a portion of each sale. In the future funding may also be generated from staking and yield farming activities which may include community mining, validator mining, liquidity pool staking, or others. All funding in the Titan DAC will be used to support the goal of the DAC. Funds will not be distributed to members of the DAC.

## Governance
Titan DAC seeks to be a truly decentralized autonomous company with no central leadership. Decisions on how the DAC operates will be left to voters in the DAC. While anyone can join the DAC and participate only members that posses Titan DAC NFT's will be able to vote. Members will receive 1 vote per Titan DAC NFT the possess.

## Titan DAC NFT
The initial Titan DAC NFT's will be limited collectors items in partnership with the Metislab Foundation to commemorate the launch of Andromeda. The Andromeda Edition NFT's will have additional benefits and privileges over NFT's we may mint in the future.

## Titan DAC NFT Andromeda Edition
### Benefits/Value
1. Limited supply. Only 15 will be created
1. Mining benefits. At the start of mining any wallet address with a Titan DAC Andromeda Edition NFT will receive a boost in mining power. Note: once mining starts, the mining power boost will not transfer with the NFT if it's sold or transfered 
1. Special rewards at community parties/events (TBD)
1. Voting power. Initially owners will be invited to the private Titan DAC group chat where they can influence early decisions in the DAC. In the future the NFT will give 1 vote in DAC governance decisions.

### Minting
All 15 NFT's will be minted using metacraft on the Andromeda L2. Minting will take place on Sunday Nov. 21. We do not have a smart contract to handle minting/sale of these yet therefore we will have to mint/sell them from a private wallet. If we can enable a multisig wallet on Andromeda we will transfer the funds there. Otherwise, if it's possible to deposit the funds directly into the DAC wallet we will deposit them there. Otherwise we will deposit them into a polis address.

### Sale Proceeds
The purpose of these NFT's are to fund the goal of this DAC, not for enriching its founders. We will use 5% of the sales to reward the designer. 15% may be used to reward members of the DAC based on their contributions. The rest will go to the DAC to fund its goals.
